# Restaurant Ordering System (C++)

Simple console-based restaurant ordering system (C++). The program reads menu data from text files and provides a basic interactive ordering flow.

**Features**
- Console UI for selecting menu items and placing orders
- Menu data stored in plain text files for easy editing
- Single-file source for easy compilation and testing

**Repository files**
- `Source.cpp` — main program source
- `beverages.txt`, `longDrinks.txt`, `mainCourse.txt`, `salads.txt` — menu data files

**Usage**
- Ensure the menu files (e.g., `beverages.txt`, `mainCourse.txt`) are in the same directory as the executable.
- Run the executable; follow console prompts to select items and place an order.
